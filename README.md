# Curriculum-by-Masking
This repository contains a PyTorch reproduction of the research paper "CBM: Curriculum by Masking" (Jarcă et al., 2024).  It implements a novel Curriculum Learning strategy that creates an "easy-to-hard" training schedule by masking image patches based on their Gradient Magnitude (Salience).
